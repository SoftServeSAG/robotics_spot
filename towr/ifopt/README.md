*A modern, light-weight, [Eigen]-based C++ interface to Nonlinear Programming solvers, such as [Ipopt] and [Snopt].*

An example nonlinear optimization problem to solve is defined as:

<img align="center" height="100" src="https://i.imgur.com/YGi4LrR.png"/>

* To see how this problem is formulated, see [*test_vars_constr_cost.h*](ifopt_core/test/ifopt/test_vars_constr_cost.h).   
* Afterwards the problem can be solved using e.g. Ipopt as shown in [*ex_test_ipopt.cc*](ifopt_ipopt/test/ex_test_ipopt.cc).

## Features
*Combines* the advantages of [Ipopt] / [Snopt] and [Eigen]:

[Ipopt] / [Snopt]  | [Eigen] 
----------|---------
:heavy_check_mark: high-quality solvers for nonlinear optimization  | :heavy_check_mark: modern, intuitive formulations of vectors and matrices 
:x: C++ API inconvenient and error-prone (raw pointers, index management, jacobian construction) | :heavy_check_mark: highly efficient implementations   
:x: linking and exporting difficult  | 

* Solver independent formulation of variables and constraints with Eigen (highly efficient)     
* Automatic index management by formulation of [variable- and constraint-sets](http://docs.ros.org/api/ifopt/html/group__ProblemFormulation.html)  
* Integration: pure cmake `find_package(ifopt)` or [catkin]/[ROS] (optional)       
* light-weight (~[2k lines of code](https://i.imgur.com/NCPJsSw.png)) makes it easy to use and extend    


## Install
The easiest way to install is through the [ROS binaries](http://wiki.ros.org/ifopt) and you're all set!
```
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-ifopt
```

#### Install dependencies
In case you don't use ROS or the binaries don't exist for your distro, you can easily build these
packages from source. For this, install the required dependencies [Cmake], [Eigen] and [Ipopt] using
```
sudo apt-get install cmake libeigen3-dev coinor-libipopt-dev
```
If you want to link to a local installation of [Ipopt] or to [Snopt], see [here](#additional-information).

#### Build with cmake
* Install
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ethz-adrl/ifopt.git && cd ifopt
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install # copies files in this folder to /usr/local/*
  # sudo xargs rm < install_manifest.txt # in case you want to uninstall the above
  ```

* Use: To use in your cmake project, see this minimal *CMakeLists.txt*:
  ```cmake
  find_package(ifopt)
  # Formulate (ifopt:ifopt_core) and solve (ifopt::ifopt_ipopt) the problem
  add_executable(main main.cpp)
  # Pull in include directories, libraries, ... 
  target_link_libraries(main PUBLIC ifopt::ifopt_ipopt) 
  ```
        
#### Build with catkin
* Install: Download [catkin] or [catkin command line tools], then:
  ```bash
  cd catkin_ws/src
  git clone https://github.com/ethz-adrl/ifopt.git
  cd ..
  catkin_make_isolated # `catkin build` if you are using catkin command-line tools 
  source ./devel/setup.bash
  ```
  
* Use: Include in your catkin project by adding to your *CMakeLists.txt* 
  ```cmake
  add_compile_options(-std=c++11)
  find_package(catkin COMPONENTS ifopt) 
  include_directories(${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})
  target_link_libraries(foo ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
  ```
  Add the following to your *package.xml*:
  ```xml
  <package>
    <depend>ifopt</depend>
  </package>
  ```
  
## Examples 
#### Unit tests & toy problem
Navigate to your build folder in which the `Makefile` resides, which depends
on how you built the code:
```bash
cd ifopt/build  # plain cmake 
cd catkin_ws/build_isolated/ifopt/devel # catkin_make_isolated
cd catkin_ws/build/ifopt # catkin build
```
Make sure everything installed correctly by running the `test` target
```bash
make test
```
You should see `ifopt_ipopt-example....Passed` (or snopt if installed) as well as `ifopt_core-test` if
[gtest] is installed.

If you have IPOPT installed and linked correctly, you can also run the [binary example](ifopt_ipopt/test/ex_test_ipopt.cc) 
directly (again, first navigate to the build folder with the `Makefile`)
```bash
make test ARGS='-R ifopt_ipopt-example -V'
```
Output:
```bash
1.0 0.0
```

#### towr
A more involved problem, taken from [towr], with multiple sets of variables and constraints to generate motions for legged robots produces the following:

## Develop
Useful information for developers is given in the doxygen documentation:

 * For an overview of how to formulate your problem, start [here](http://docs.ros.org/api/ifopt/html/group__ProblemFormulation.html).
 * A nice graphical overview as UML can be seen [here](http://docs.ros.org/api/ifopt/html/inherits.html).

## Additional Information
#### Linking to custom Ipopt or Snopt
If you are building from source and want to use a locally installed version of [Ipopt] add the path to your
Ipopt build folder to your `~/.bashrc`, e.g.
```bash
export IPOPT_DIR=/home/your_name/Code/Ipopt-3.12.8/build
```

In case your OS doesn't provide the precompiled binaries or the required version,
you can also easily install Ipopt from source as described [here](https://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation/node14.html). This summary might work for you:
```bash
wget https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/Ipopt-3.11.10.zip
unzip Ipopt-3.11.10.zip
cd Ipopt-3.11.10/ThirdParty/Mumps
./get.Mumps  # HSL routines are faster (http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/)
cd ../../
mkdir build && cd build
../configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make test
make install
export IPOPT_DIR=`pwd`
```

If you need an interface to [Snopt], point cmake to that build folder in your `~/.bashrc` through e.g.
```bash
export SNOPT_DIR=/home/your_name/Code/Snopt
```
and run cmake as 
```bash
cmake -DBUILD_SNOPT=ON ..
```
