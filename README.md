# robotics_spot
The package of Spot` controller based on [SpotMicro project](https://github.com/OpenQuadruped/spot_mini_mini).


## Install
Install docker:
Install Docker-CE using these [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

Install nvidia-docker 
```bash
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | \
  sudo apt-key add -
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nvidia-docker2
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Now we should build Spot container:

### Spot:

Init workspace

```bash
mkdir -p spot_ws/src
cd spot_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/spot_ros.git
git clone https://github.com/tarasborov/robotics_spot.git
```

Build docker images

```bash
cd robotics_spot/docker/ros_spot
chmod a+x build.bash
sudo ./build.bash 
```
Run docker container

```bash
chmod a+x run.bash
sudo ./run.bash
```

Inside docker container

```bash
cd /root/ws
rosdep check --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro melodic
catkin config --init --extend /opt/ros/melodic   
catkin build
```

## Use tmux
All following commands should be executed in specified containers:

```bash
cd ~/ws/src/robotics_spot/scripts
chmod a+x start.sh
chmod a+x session.yml
./start.sh
```
Now tmux session will start with all required tabs. All required commandsmay be added to the history, in order to simplify their usage.

## Start Gazebo
Launch world SoftServe office:
```bash
roslaunch rs_gazebo HQ.launch
```
Launch the specific world:
```bash
roslaunch rs_gazebo HQ.launch world_name:="<world_name>"
```
Spawn robot:
```bash
roslaunch rs_gazebo robot.launch 
```
Spawn robot with the specific name and position:
```bash
roslaunch rs_gazebo robot.launch robot_name:="<spot_name>"  init_pose:="-x 0.0 -y 0.0 -z 0.0"
```
## Control
You can control Spot in the two ways: using forward or inverse kinematics. Forward kinematics means to send command on actuator directly. To run hardcoded actuators` command just run:
```bash
roslaunch rs_control talker.launch 
```
Run for the specific robot:
```bash
roslaunch rs_control talker.launch robot_name:="<spot_name>"
```

Inverse kinematics means to predetermine joins angels by calculating kinematics relationships between joints. To calculate gait we use algorithm frrom [SpotMicro project](https://github.com/OpenQuadruped/spot_mini_mini).
In order to control Spot using inverse kinematics and MIT control use the following commands: 

Start a controller:
```bash
roslaunch rs_inverse inverse.launch
```
Run for the specific robot:
```bash
roslaunch rs_inverse inverse.launch robot_name:="<spot_name>"
```
Launch GUI to send command:
```bash
roslaunch rs_inverse gui_spot.launch
```
Run GUI for the specific robot:
```bash
roslaunch rs_inverse gui_spot.launch robot_name:="<spot_name>"
```
Launch a teleop to control Spot:
```bash
roslaunch rs_teleop teleop_spot.launch
```
Run teleop for the specific robot:
```bash
roslaunch rs_teleop teleop_spot.launch robot_name:="<spot_name>"
```
